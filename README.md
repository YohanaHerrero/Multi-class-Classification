I convert a linear classifier into a multi-class classifier, including multinomial logistic regression or softmax regression, One vs. All (One-vs-Rest) and One vs. One.

I plot the probabilities of belonging to each class and the different boundaries to carry out the classifications. I also calculate the model accuracies.
